# Site Audit Dashboard
A react application that aggregates amazon data for a specified vendor. It allows data comparison for a day ago, week ago, and month ago. 

I do not own the product so I am not allowed to share our codebase.

Disclaimer: This is a demo application of a dev branch so functionality has been reduced and performance has not been tested.

This application incorporates the following packages:

- axios
- bcryptjs
- jsonwebtoken
- passport
- react-router-dom
